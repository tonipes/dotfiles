## My Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. These are used with Arch Linux distribution, but there should not be any reason why they wouldn't work on any other distro/os. 

To manage dotfiles, I use [dotfile manager by jbernard](https://github.com/jbernard/dotfiles)

Note that using these dotfiles require zsh.
